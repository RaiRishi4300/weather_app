## 📍Project Title-:

Weather App

## 💻Functionality-:

I have made a Weather App through which user will be able to  find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city he/she can think of!

## 🧾Learning Side-:

-> How to network with the Dart http package.</br>
-> What APIs are and how to use them to get data from the internet.</br>
-> What JSONs are and how to parse them using the Dart convert package.</br>
-> How to pass data forwards and backwards between screens using the Navigator.</br>
-> How to use the Geolocator package to get live location data for both iOS and Android.</br>



## How it looks finally!!!
